# i2b2v2-webclient-demo
This is a docker demonstration of the new i2b2 webclient version 2.  Note that the new version of the webclient is still in progress.  This demo is for people to test out the new UI interface.  The Docker image will updated often until the official version released.

## Run the i2b2v2 Webclient Demo

### Prerequisites

- [Docker 19 or above](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Prebuilt Docker Container Images

Prebuilt Docker container images have been created demonstration purposes:

- [i2b2-idp-demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/kvb2univpitt/i2b2-idp-demo)
- [i2b2-data-demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/kvb2univpitt/i2b2-data-demo-postgresql)
- [i2b2-core-server-demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/kvb2univpitt/i2b2-core-server-demo-postgresql)
- [i2b2v2-webclient-demo](https://hub.docker.com/r/kvb2univpitt/i2b2v2-webclient-demo)

### Docker User-defined Bridge Network

The containers run on a user-defined bridge network ***i2b2-demo-net***.  The user-defined bridge network provides better isolation and allows containers on the same network to communicate with each other using their container names instead of their IP addresses.

#### Ensure User-defined Bridge Network Exists

To verify that the network ***i2b2-demo-net*** exists, execute the following command to list all of the Docker's networks:

```
docker network ls
```

The output should be similar to this:

```
NETWORK ID     NAME            DRIVER    SCOPE
d86843421945   bridge          bridge    local
58593240ad9d   host            host      local
9a82abc00473   i2b2-demo-net   bridge    local
```

If ***i2b2-demo-net*** network is **not** listed, execute the following command to create it:

```
docker network create i2b2-demo-net
```

### Run Demo

Open up a terminal and execute the following commands to download and run the prebuilt Docker container images:

###### Linux / macOS:

```
docker run -d --name=i2b2-data-demo \
--network i2b2-demo-net \
-e POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=demouser \
-p 5432:5432 \
kvb2univpitt/i2b2-data-demo-postgresql:v1.7.13.2022.06

docker run -d --name=i2b2-core-server-demo \
--network i2b2-demo-net \
-p 9090:9090 \
kvb2univpitt/i2b2-core-server-demo-postgresql:v1.7.13.2022.06

docker run -d --name=i2b2v2-webclient-demo \
--network i2b2-demo-net \
-p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
kvb2univpitt/i2b2v2-webclient-demo:recover.snapshot.2
```

###### Windows

```
docker run -d --name=i2b2-data-demo ^
--network i2b2-demo-net ^
-e POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=demouser ^
-p 5432:5432 ^
kvb2univpitt/i2b2-data-demo-postgresql:v1.7.13.2022.06

docker run -d --name=i2b2-core-server-demo ^
--network i2b2-demo-net ^
-p 9090:9090 ^
kvb2univpitt/i2b2-core-server-demo-postgresql:v1.7.13.2022.06

docker run -d --name=i2b2v2-webclient-demo ^
--network i2b2-demo-net ^
-p 80:80 -p 443:443 ^
kvb2univpitt/i2b2v2-webclient-demo:recover.snapshot.2
```

### Access the Web Client

Open up a web browser and go to the URL [https://localhost/webclient_v2/](https://localhost/webclient_v2/).

The browser will show a security warning because the SSL certificates are ***not*** signed and validated by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  Click "Accept the Risk and Continue"

![SSL Warning Page](img/ssl_warning.png)

The browser will show the login page, as shown below.  Log in with the following credentials:

| Attribute | Value    |
|-----------|----------|
| Username  | demo     |
| Password  | demouser |

![Login Page](img/login_page.png)

Once logged in, the main page will show like the one below:

### Docker Container and Image Management

Execute the following to stop the running Docker container:

```
docker stop i2b2v2-webclient-demo
```

Execute the following to delete the Docker container:

```
docker rm i2b2v2-webclient-demo

```

## Build the Image

### Prerequisites

- [Docker or above](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Build the Docker Image:

Open up a terminal in the directory **i2b2-demo/i2b2v2-webclient-demo**, where the ***Dockerfile*** file is, and execute the following command to build the image:

```
docker build -t local/i2b2v2-webclient-demo .
```

To verify that the image has been built, execute the following command to list the Docker images:

```
docker images
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```
REPOSITORY                    TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
